# Advent Of Code

As everyone knows, Christmas is the most beautiful time of the year to which we countdown impatiently.

But there is no fun in waiting for Christmas without awsome advent callendar!

That is why I solve one puzzle per day - to appreciate this time, challenge myself and practice programming.
And as if that were not enough, the whole game is wrapped with a great plot which makes it even more fascinating!
